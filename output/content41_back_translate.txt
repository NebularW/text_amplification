Member units of the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic prevention and control leading group of each city, county (city, district) and the provincial novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic prevention and control leading group:In order to thoroughly implement the general strategy of "external prevention input, internal prevention rebound" and the general policy of "dynamic zeroing", effectively coordinate the epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, further do a good job in the health management of key personnel and the whole process closed-loop control, and firmly hold the bottom line that there will be no off pipe leakage of personnel from medium and high-risk areas who come to and return to Zhejiang, with the consent of the provincial novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic prevention and control leading group, the relevant requirements are hereby notified as follows:1、 Specific measures for standardizing health management（1） Centralized isolation medical observation.The "Health Code" of the centralized isolated medical observer is given a red code. A single room lives in the designated centralized isolated medical observation place, avoiding direct contact with others as much as possible. In the case of receiving and releasing isolation and requiring transfer, personal protective measures shall be standardized and implemented to maintain a distance of more than 1m between personnel. Strictly avoid cross infection.Children under the age of 14, pregnant and lying in women, those with serious basic diseases, semi self-care and those without self-care ability who are not suitable for living alone can be implemented in accordance with the guidance on the management of specific personnel for centralized isolation medical observation (provincial epidemic prevention and Control Office [2020] No. 72) after being assessed by the staff in the centralized isolation place; In case of special circumstances, the centralized isolation medical observer (or his legal guardian) may apply for home isolation medical observation with the consent of the local epidemic prevention and control department.（2） Home isolation medical observation. The "Health Code" of home isolation medical observers is given a red code. During isolation, they must stay at home and refuse all visits. Personal protective measures shall be standardized and implemented at the door opening links such as collecting articles, putting garbage and nucleic acid sampling, and hand hygiene shall be done before and after the door is opened. The "Health Code" of the residents is given a red code, and the control measures and nucleic acid detection frequency are the same as those of the home isolation medical observers; When taking care of the isolated personnel, they should wear masks in a standardized way, minimize contact, adopt the serving of individual dishes, and avoid sharing tableware, towels, bath towels, bed sheets and other items. Isolation personnel shall use special catering utensils and special toilets if possible.（3） Home health observation. The "Health Code" of the home health observer is assigned with a yellow code. It is a single room with an independent bathroom. Do not leave home unless necessary for medical treatment; If you really need to leave home, you must obtain the approval of the village (community) or unit in charge of its control, go "point-to-point" under the premise of personal protection, and do not take public transport. In principle, nucleic acid sampling shall be arranged by the community. It is recommended that home health observers live alone; If the family needs to live together, the "Health Code" of the people living together is given a yellow code, and the control measures and nucleic acid detection frequency are the same as those of the home health observers. The co residents shall live independently with the home health observer at home, avoid contact, and shall not share tableware, towels, bath towels, bed sheets and other items. If the personnel requiring home health observation do not have the conditions for home health observation, they can conduct home health observation in the hotel designated by the territorial Government.（4） Daily health monitoring. The "Health Code" of daily health monitoring personnel is given a green code, but it is required to control the scope of activities. They are not allowed to take public transport, participate in gatherings such as conferences, exhibitions, tourism and dinners, enter specific institutions such as schools, nurseries, nursing homes and welfare homes, enter indoor closed places such as movie theaters, song and dance halls, chess and card rooms, bars, Internet cafes and public bathrooms, and do not carry out offline teaching, training and other activities. Each city divided into districts can restrict the daily health monitoring personnel from entering the above public places by marking on the "place code" display interface. During the daily health monitoring, the personnel shall wear masks in a standardized way during the whole process of going out, and effectively maintain a safe social distance. In principle, they shall not leave their districts or cities before the daily health monitoring.2、 Optimize health management of inbound personnelImplement "7+7" health management measures for inbound personnel: first, implement 7-day centralized isolation medical observation, and conduct nucleic acid detection on the first, second, third, fifth and seventh days respectively, of which the seventh day is "double sampling and double detection"; If the above nucleic acid test is negative, continue to carry out home health observation for 7 days, and conduct nucleic acid test once on the 2nd, 4th and 7th days respectively. If the result is negative, end the health management measures.After the centralized isolation medical observation is completed, the people who enter the province at the port of our province and are destined to the province are under the overall responsibility of the municipal government divided into districts at the destination, and are transferred to the destination in a closed loop for home health observation. At present, the entry personnel who are still in the period of centralized isolation medical observation for more than 7 days can be transferred to home health observation after one "double sampling and double examination", and the excess days can be offset by the subsequent days of home health observation.For those who enter our province at the port and whose destination is outside the province, after completing the centralized isolation medical observation, and promise not to return to Zhejiang within 7 days, the epidemic prevention and control department at the destination outside the province shall confirm and implement the "point-to-point" pick-up by special personnel. When leaving the centralized isolated medical observation place, the "Health Code" is assigned a yellow code, and automatically turns to a green code after 7 days. Those who do not meet the above conditions of "point-to-point" connection should continue to implement 7-day home health observation in Zhejiang; Those who do not have the conditions for home health observation can conduct home health observation in the hotels designated by the territorial Government. After the home health observation period expires, the health management measures will be ended, and the "Health Code" will be given a green code. You can leave Zhejiang by public transport.Those who enter the province at a port other than the province and whose destination is our province, and have implemented health management measures at the first place of entry for 14 days, do not need to be controlled after entering Zhejiang; For those less than 14 days, they shall be transferred to the destination according to the current closed-loop transfer requirements after entering Zhejiang, and the "7+7" health management measures shall be supplemented. The personnel who enter Shanghai port and are destined to our province will be transferred to Jiaxing for centralized isolation for 4 days after 3 days in Shanghai. After the expiration of the period, the municipal government divided into districts at the destination will be responsible for the overall planning and closed-loop transfer to the destination in the province for 7 days of home health observation.3、 Optimize the health management of key domestic personnel（1） We will implement "7+7" health management measures for personnel in areas with medium to high risk of domestic epidemic.Personnel from high-risk areas in the domestic epidemic situation should postpone coming to and returning to Zhejiang for a while, and arrange travel after the risk level in the area is reduced to low risk. For those who have come to Zhejiang and returned to Zhejiang, the "7+7" health management measures shall be implemented.If there are social positive infected persons outside the province, but no medium and high-risk areas have been designated, the residence, place of activity and place of work of the positive infected persons can be managed with reference to the medium and high-risk areas after experts' research and judgment. If the division of medium and high-risk areas outside the province is smaller than that of towns (streets), the people from the towns (streets) where the above medium and high-risk areas are located can be regarded as the people from medium and high-risk areas.（2） The "7+7" health management measures shall be implemented with reference to the personnel in closed or static management areas and the accompanying personnel in the same time and space.The "7+7" health management measures can be implemented for those who come to Zhejiang and return to Zhejiang in the community where the epidemic has spread and in the areas where the local government has announced the implementation of closed management or static management. After the local government cancels the whole area closed management or static management, it will no longer implement the corresponding health management measures for the people who come to Zhejiang and return to Zhejiang from the counties (cities, districts) or streets (towns) of municipalities directly under the central government where the non medium and high-risk areas are located within the original control range.For those who appear at the same time and in the same space as the positive infected person, if they have not been identified as close contacts, they can refer to the implementation of "7+7" health management measures after comprehensive evaluation.（3） Implement "3+4" health management measures for other personnel in counties (cities, districts) or streets (towns) of municipalities directly under the central government and personnel in temporary traffic control areas where high-risk areas are located. Other personnel of the county (city, district) or street (township) of the municipality directly under the central government where the high-risk area in the domestic epidemic situation is located do not come to and return to Zhejiang unnecessarily, and arrange travel after the risk level of the area is reduced to low risk. For those who have come to Zhejiang and returned to Zhejiang, the "3+4" health management measures shall be implemented: that is, 3-day home health observation shall be carried out first, and nucleic acid detection shall be carried out once in the first and third days respectively; If the above nucleic acid test is negative, it will be included in the daily health monitoring for 4 days. If the nucleic acid test is negative on the second and fourth days, the health management measures will be ended.（4） 7-day routine health monitoring shall be carried out for those who need to leave the region, the whole region nucleic acid testing area and pass through the transportation hub with epidemic risk.For other persons who come to and return to Zhejiang with negative nucleic acid test certificates and who are required to leave only after the passengers have obtained negative nucleic acid test certificates in the cities divided into districts or under the jurisdiction of municipalities directly under the central government where the high-risk areas in the domestic epidemic situation are located, 7-day routine health monitoring shall be implemented: nucleic acid test shall be conducted once in the first, third, fifth and seventh days respectively, and the results are negative. The health management measures shall be ended.For the key areas that have not yet been designated as medium and high risk areas, but have positive infected persons and have implemented the global nucleic acid test, the above health management measures can be implemented for the personnel who come to and return to Zhejiang within the designated nucleic acid test range. If the medium and high risk areas are subsequently defined, the health management measures shall be changed for the personnel coming to and returning to Zhejiang according to the medium and high risk areas.For those who have been infected by staff or service personnel in airports, railway stations, passenger stations, water transport terminals and other transport hubs, but have not been designated as medium and high-risk areas, after comprehensive assessment, the above health management measures can be implemented for those who come to and return to Zhejiang from or through the above transport hubs. If it is subsequently designated as a medium and high risk area, the health management measures shall be changed according to the medium and high risk areas.（5） Implement health management measures for the personnel in the epidemic areas in the province.For medium and high-risk areas in the province or those with social positive infection but not yet defined as medium and high-risk areas, health management measures shall be taken for overflow personnel according to the locally announced medium and high-risk areas or the range of containment areas, control areas and prevention areas. Among them, "7+7" health management measures shall be implemented for overflow personnel in medium and high risk areas and sealed control areas in the province; Implement "3+4" health management measures for overflow personnel in the control area of the province; Carry out 7-day daily health monitoring for spill prevention personnel in the province. In the case of a city divided into districts where the epidemic situation is located, if it is found that the number of the above-mentioned personnel overflowing to other counties (cities, districts) of the city divided into districts is large and the resources such as centralized isolation sites cannot be met, the health management measures for the above-mentioned personnel may be temporarily changed with the consent of the provincial epidemic prevention and control office.（6） Other temporary health management measures. In areas or places with serious epidemic situation, after the comprehensive assessment organized by the Provincial Health Commission and the consent of the provincial epidemic prevention and control office, the personnel with a history of residence and contact in epidemic related areas can be promoted or other health management measures can be taken temporarily.4、 Define relevant requirements for health management（1） Traceability of health management measures to the population. The retroactive date of health management measures for the controlled population implementing health management measures shall be determined according to the relevant announcements issued in the region; If the relevant announcement is not clear, the date of discovery of the positive infected person determined in the announcement shall be traced back for 7 days, and the details shall be determined by the Provincial Center for Disease Control and prevention after study.（2） Start and end of health management measures. Health management measures shall be calculated from the date when key personnel leave the medium and high risk areas or other epidemic related areas. When the medium and high-risk areas are reduced to low-risk areas, they are still under health management
